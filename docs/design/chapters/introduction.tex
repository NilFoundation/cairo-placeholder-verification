\chapter{Introduction}

This document is a technical reference to the Solana's state proof verification
with Cairo project.

\section{Overview}

The project's purpose is to provide StarkNet users with reliable Solana's cluster 
state and necessary transactions proof source.

The project UX consists of several steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Retrieve Solana's state proof from \texttt{=nil;}.
    \item Generate a STARK proof for it.
    \item Verify the proof with in-StarkNet Cairo-based verifier.
\end{enumerate}

Such a UX defines projects parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solana's state proof retriever.
    \item Auxiliary STARK proof generator.
    \item Cairo-based Placeholder Verifier.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these parts will be considered independently.
