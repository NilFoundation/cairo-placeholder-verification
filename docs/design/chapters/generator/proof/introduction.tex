\section{Proof System}
\label{section:proof_system}
\textbf{WIP}

The proof system used for proving Solana's 'Light-Client' state on EVM is Redshift SNARK\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:1400}.
RedShift is a transparent SNARK that uses PLONK\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:953} proof system but replaces the commitment scheme.
Initial paper proposal is to employ FRI\cite{ben2018fast} protocol to obtain transparency for the PLONK system.

However, FRI cannot be straightforwardly used with the PLONK system.
To achieve the required security level without huge overheads, the authors introduce \textit{list polynomial commitment} scheme as a part of the protocol.
For more details, the reader gets referred to \cite{cryptoeprint:2019:1400}.

The original RedShift protocol utilizes the classic PLONK\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:953} system.
To provide better performance, the original protocol is generalized to be used
with PLONK with custom gates \cite{turbo}, \cite{plonkhalo2} and lookup arguments \cite{cryptoeprint:2020:315}, \cite{lookuphalo2}.
